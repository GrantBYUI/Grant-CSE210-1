    // Finally, you should provide a GetSummary method to produce a string with all the summary information.
    // Remember that the summary method can make use of the other methods to produce its result. This method should be available for all classes, so it should be defined in the base class (you can override it in the derived classes if needed, but it may not need to be...).

    // Once you have the classes in place, write a program that creates at least one activity of each type. Put each of these activities in the same list. Then iterate through this list and call the GetSummary method on each item and display the results.

    // In addition, your program must:

    // Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
    // Use method overriding for the calculation methods.
    // Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.
    // Math Hints:
    // Distance (km) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000
    // Distance (miles) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000 * 0.62
    // Speed (mph or kph) = (distance / minutes) * 60
    // Pace (min per mile or min per km)= minutes / distance
    // Speed = 60 / pace
    // Pace = 60 / speed
